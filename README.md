📦 Dependencies
The notebook uses the following libraries:

pandas, numpy: Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn: Data visualization

scikit-learn: Preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation

xgboost, lightgbm: Gradient boosting algorithms

kagglehub: Likely for dataset access or downloading

warnings: For controlling warning messages

Install all dependencies via:

bash

🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository or download this notebook.

Install the required packages.

Open the notebook and follow the sequential steps for end-to-end model development.

Modify preprocessing or models as needed for your specific dataset.

📌 Notes
The pipeline is modular and easy to adapt to different classification problems.

Feature selection uses SelectKBest and PCA.

Model tuning is done with GridSearchCV.
